--    Phy definition
--    
--    Throughout this document phy is used as an abbreviation
--    for Physical Interface.  In particular it refers to a
--    physical ATM jack on a Catalyst 5000 ATM card.  This card
--    can be fitted with either one or two physical jacks, only
--    one of which may be active at any given moment.  The second
--    phy serves as a redundant connector to the ATM backbone.
--    Note, however, that for logistical reasons, each phy has
--    a separate ifIndex.
--    
--    
--    Support of the phy by ifTable
--    
--    The dual phy entity on the c5K ATM line card is managed
--    using the ifTable.  Specific interpretations of ifTable
--    for the dual phy entity are as follows.
--    
--    Object   Use for dual phy entity
--    ======   =======================
--    
--    ifIndex  Each phy entity is represented by an ifEntry.
--    
--    ifDescr  Description of the phy entity.
--    
--    ifType   The value for the phy entity is other(1).
--    
--    ifSpeed  See [1].
--    
--    ifPhysAddress   An octet string of zero length, per [1].
--    
--    ifAdminStatus   See [1].
--    
--    ifOperStatus    See [1].  In addition, note that a phy can
--                            be in the up state but still not be the
--                            active phy.  However, the active phy will
--                            always be up.

--    ifLastChange    See [1].

--    ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable     disabled(2).
