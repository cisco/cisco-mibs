--    This MIB module defines textual conventions for
--     representing Internet addresses.  An Internet
--     address can be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address,
--     or a DNS domain name.  This module also defines
--     textual conventions for Internet port numbers,
--     autonomous system numbers, and the length of an
--     Internet address prefix.
--    
--     Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2005).  This version
--     of this MIB module is part of RFC 4001, see the RFC
--     itself for full legal notices.

InetAddressType ::= INTEGER {
--         unknown(0),
        ipv4(1),
        ipv6(2),
        ipv4z(3),
        ipv6z(4),
        dns(16)
        }
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    A value that represents a type of Internet address.
--    
--     unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST
--                 be used if the value of the corresponding
--                 InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
--                 It may also be used to indicate an IP address
--                 that is not in one of the formats defined
--                 below.
--    
--     ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the
--                 InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.
--    
--     ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
--                 InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.
--    
--     ipv4z(3)    A non-global IPv4 address including a zone
--                 index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z
--                 textual convention.
--    
--     ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone
--                 index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z
--                 textual convention.
--    
--     dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
--                 InetAddressDNS textual convention.
--    
--     Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
--     accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
--     with that InetAddressType.
--    
--     To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
--     convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
--     It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
--     require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
--     implementation.
--    
--     Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
--     and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
--     consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
--     if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
--     for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In
--    
--    
--     particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
--     changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from
--     ipv6(2) to ipv4(1)).

InetAddress ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..255))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Denotes a generic Internet address.
--    
--     An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
--     of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
--     textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
--     object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
--     InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
--     object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
--     they appear in the same logical row.
--    
--     The value of an InetAddress object must always be
--     consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
--     object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
--     inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
--     must fail with an inconsistentValue error.
--    
--     When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
--     index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
--     sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
--     the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
--     limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
--     otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
--     the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
--     in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
--     DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate.

InetAddressIPv4 ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(4))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    1d.1d.1d.1d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents an IPv4 network address:

--    
--       Octets   Contents         Encoding
--        1-4     IPv4 address     network-byte order
--    
--     The corresponding InetAddressType value is ipv4(1).
--    
--     This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in object
--     definitions, as it restricts addresses to a specific format.
--     However, if it is used, it MAY be used either on its own or in
--     conjunction with InetAddressType, as a pair.

InetAddressIPv6 ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(16))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x
--  Status
--    mandatory

--       Octets   Contents         Encoding
--        1-16    IPv6 address     network-byte order
--    
--     The corresponding InetAddressType value is ipv6(2).
--    
--     This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in object
--     definitions, as it restricts addresses to a specific format.
--     However, if it is used, it MAY be used either on its own or in
--     conjunction with InetAddressType, as a pair.

InetAddressIPv4z ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(8))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    1d.1d.1d.1d%4d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a non-global IPv4 network address, together
--     with its zone index:
--    
--       Octets   Contents         Encoding
--        1-4     IPv4 address     network-byte order
--        5-8     zone index       network-byte order
--    
--     The corresponding InetAddressType value is ipv4z(3).
--    
--     The zone index (bytes 5-8) is used to disambiguate identical
--     address values on nodes that have interfaces attached to
--     different zones of the same scope.  The zone index may contain
--     the special value 0, which refers to the default zone for each
--     scope.
--    
--     This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in object
--    
--    
--     definitions, as it restricts addresses to a specific format.
--     However, if it is used, it MAY be used either on its own or in
--     conjunction with InetAddressType, as a pair.

InetAddressIPv6z ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(20))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x:2x%4d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a non-global IPv6 network address, together
--     with its zone index:
--    
--       Octets   Contents         Encoding
--        1-16    IPv6 address     network-byte order
--       17-20    zone index       network-byte order
--    
--     The corresponding InetAddressType value is ipv6z(4).
--    
--     The zone index (bytes 17-20) is used to disambiguate
--     identical address values on nodes that have interfaces
--     attached to different zones of the same scope.  The zone index
--     may contain the special value 0, which refers to the default
--     zone for each scope.
--    
--     This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in object
--     definitions, as it restricts addresses to a specific format.
--     However, if it is used, it MAY be used either on its own or in
--     conjunction with InetAddressType, as a pair.

InetAddressDNS ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..255))
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    255a
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a DNS domain name.  The name SHOULD be fully
--     qualified whenever possible.
--    
--     The corresponding InetAddressType is dns(16).
--    
--     The DESCRIPTION clause of InetAddress objects that may have
--     InetAddressDNS values MUST fully describe how (and when)
--     these names are to be resolved to IP addresses.
--    
--     The resolution of an InetAddressDNS value may require to
--     query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4 and AAAA for
--     IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and which DNS
--     record takes precedence depends on the configuration of the
--     resolver.
--    
--    
--     This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in object
--     definitions, as it restricts addresses to a specific format.
--     However, if it is used, it MAY be used either on its own or in
--     conjunction with InetAddressType, as a pair.

InetAddressPrefixLength ::= Gauge(0..2040)
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Denotes the length of a generic Internet network address
--     prefix.  A value of n corresponds to an IP address mask
--     that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most significant
--     bit (MSB), with all other bits set to 0.
--    
--     An InetAddressPrefixLength value is always interpreted within
--     the context of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the
--     InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention is required to
--     specify the InetAddressType object that provides the
--     context.  It is suggested that the InetAddressType object be
--     logically registered before the object(s) that use the
--     InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention, if they appear
--     in the same logical row.
--    
--     InetAddressPrefixLength values larger than
--     the maximum length of an IP address for a specific
--     InetAddressType are treated as the maximum significant
--     value applicable for the InetAddressType.  The maximum
--     significant value is 32 for the InetAddressType
--     'ipv4(1)' and 'ipv4z(3)' and 128 for the InetAddressType
--     'ipv6(2)' and 'ipv6z(4)'.  The maximum significant value
--     for the InetAddressType 'dns(16)' is 0.
--    
--     The value zero is object-specific and must be defined as
--     part of the description of any object that uses this
--     syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
--     situations where the Internet network address prefix
--     is unknown or does not apply.
--    
--     The upper bound of the prefix length has been chosen to
--     be consistent with the maximum size of an InetAddress.

InetPortNumber ::= Gauge(0..65535)
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a 16 bit port number of an Internet transport
--    
--    
--     layer protocol.  Port numbers are assigned by IANA.  A
--     current list of all assignments is available from
--     <http://www.iana.org/>.
--    
--     The value zero is object-specific and must be defined as
--     part of the description of any object that uses this
--     syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
--     situations where a port number is unknown, or when the
--     value zero is used as a wildcard in a filter.
--  Refer
--    STD 6 (RFC 768), STD 7 (RFC 793) and RFC 2960

InetAutonomousSystemNumber ::= Gauge
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents an autonomous system number that identifies an
--     Autonomous System (AS).  An AS is a set of routers under a
--     single technical administration, using an interior gateway
--     protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS,
--     and using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to
--     other ASes'.  IANA maintains the AS number space and has
--     delegated large parts to the regional registries.
--    
--     Autonomous system numbers are currently limited to 16 bits
--     (0..65535).  There is, however, work in progress to enlarge the
--     autonomous system number space to 32 bits.  Therefore, this
--     textual convention uses an Unsigned32 value without a
--     range restriction in order to support a larger autonomous
--     system number space.
--  Refer
--    RFC 1771, RFC 1930

InetScopeType ::= INTEGER {
        interfaceLocal(1),
        linkLocal(2),
        subnetLocal(3),
        adminLocal(4),
        siteLocal(5),
        organizationLocal(8),
        global(14)
        }
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    Represents a scope type.  This textual convention can be used
--     in cases where a MIB has to represent different scope types
--     and there is no context information, such as an InetAddress
--     object, that implicitly defines the scope type.
--    
--     Note that not all possible values have been assigned yet, but
--     they may be assigned in future revisions of this specification.
--     Applications should therefore be able to deal with values
--     not yet assigned.
--  Refer
--    RFC 3513

InetZoneIndex ::= Gauge
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  DspHint
--    d
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    A zone index identifies an instance of a zone of a
--     specific scope.
--    
--     The zone index MUST disambiguate identical address
--     values.  For link-local addresses, the zone index will
--     typically be the interface index (ifIndex as defined in the
--     IF-MIB) of the interface on which the address is configured.
--    
--     The zone index may contain the special value 0, which refers
--     to the default zone.  The default zone may be used in cases
--     where the valid zone index is not known (e.g., when a
--     management application has to write a link-local IPv6
--     address without knowing the interface index value).  The
--     default zone SHOULD NOT be used as an easy way out in
--     cases where the zone index for a non-global IPv6 address
--     is known.
--  Refer
--    RFC4007

InetVersion ::= INTEGER {
        --?? enum value of zero may cause problems
        unknown(0),
        ipv4(1),
        ipv6(2)
        }
-- TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
--  Status
--    mandatory
--  Descr
--    A value representing a version of the IP protocol.
--    
--     unknown(0)  An unknown or unspecified version of the IP
--                 protocol.
--    
--    
--     ipv4(1)     The IPv4 protocol as defined in RFC 791 (STD 5).
--    
--     ipv6(2)     The IPv6 protocol as defined in RFC 2460.
--    
--     Note that this textual convention SHOULD NOT be used to
--     distinguish different address types associated with IP
--     protocols.  The InetAddressType has been designed for this
--     purpose.

--    RFC 791, RFC 2460
