        setting this object  will  have  the side  effect   of
        reinitializing  the  LES and consequently dropping all
        clients connected  to  it.   If  this  object is   not
        specified    at row creation  time  then  the LES will
        choose a value for itself and attempt to register with
        the  switch    with  that value.   If    an address is
        specified which is  not acceptable to the  switch then

        lesAtmAddrSpec  specifies the portion  of the LES' ATM
        address that is desired  to be configured.  Note  that
        setting   this    object   will     result     in  the
        reinitialization of  the LES,consequently dropping all
        clients connected to it.  Note that this object cannot
        be set at row  creation time without also  supplying a
        value for the  lesAtmAddrSpec object.  If the LES  ATM
        address  is omitted at creation  time then this object
        defaults  to  the  value of   all  zeros (none  of the
        lesAtmAddrSpec value   is relevant). If  the  LES  ATM
        address is specified at  creation time but this object

        separate creation/deletion of   the LES and   BUS this
        object allows the operator  to specify the ATM address
        of the BUS at  LES creation time.  For implementations
        that allow separate  process  creation this object  is
        optional.   Otherwise this is  the  ATM address of the
        designated BUS.   Note that setting  this object  will
        have the side  effect  of reinitializing the  BUS  and
        consequently dropping all clients connected to it.  If
        this object is not specified at row creation time then
        the BUS will choose a value for  itself and attempt to
        register  with the  switch  with  that value.  If   an

        setting this  object  will  have the  side  effect  of
        reinitializing  the BUS and  consequently dropping all
        clients connected to it.  Note that this object cannot

        value   for the lesColocBusAtmAddrSpec  object. If the
        BUS ATM address is omitted  at creation time then this
        object defaults to the value of all zeros (none of the
