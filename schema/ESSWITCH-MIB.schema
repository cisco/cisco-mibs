                description     "The set of the switch's member ports for the bridge group.
                 A port may reside within multiple bridge groups only if
                 the object bridgeGroupAllowMembershipOverlap has been set
                 to enabled(1).

                 This object cannot be used to configure bridge group
                 membership.  The table bridgeGroupMemberTable is used
                 for that purpose.

                 Each octet within the value of this object specifies a
                 set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports
                 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9
                 through 16, etc.   Within each octet, the most
                 significant bit represents the lowest numbered
                 port, and the least significant bit represents the
                 highest numbered port.  Thus, each port of the bridge
                 group is represented by a single bit within the
                 value of this object.  If that bit has a value of
                 '1' then that port is included in the set of
                 ports; the port is not included if its bit has a
                 value of '0'.

                 Initially, a single bridge group with all ports as its
                 members is defined."

                 All ports in the switch must belong to some bridge group.
                 Consequently, the switch will return badValue if

                 membership lists.

                 Note that when bridgeGroupAllowMembershipOverlap is disabled,
                 a port can only be member of exactly one bridge group.
                 In this case, setting bridgeGroupMemberPortOfBridgeGroup to
                 true(1) for a port adds the port to the membership list of the
                 current bridge group and removes the same port from all other
                 bridge group membership lists.

                 When bridgeGroupAllowMembershipOverlap is enabled, a port may
                 reside in multiple bridge groups.  Setting

                 the port to the membership list of the current bridge group
