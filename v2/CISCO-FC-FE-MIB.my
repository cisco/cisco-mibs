    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the Cisco fibre element management MIB module.
        It covers:
        - Cisco extension to the interface MIB ( IF-MIB )
        - Contains all the groups from FIBRE-CHANNEL-FE-MIB
          relevant to Cisco fabric.
        - Other features specific to Cisco fabric.

        This MIB supports all the port types defined by the
        textual convention FcPortTypes. In addition it also
        supports Nx_port, where Nx_port can be either N_port or
        NL_port. The FC standards define Interconnect_Ports
        to be E_ports or B_Ports.

        This MIB supports Port Channel ports. Port 
        Channel port is a single logical port, which contains 
        multiple physical ports as its members. Presently only 
        E_ports can be a member of Port Channel port.

        In addition it provides GigE and port channel information 
        for all the Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) ports in the fabric.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents the number of performance buffers of a
        physical FC-port. These buffers in addition to the 
        buffer-to-buffer credits are used to improve the
        performance of a port, hence called
        'Performance buffers'. A value of zero for this
        means the agent uses the built-in algorithm to
        calculate the number of performance buffers to be
        used."

        at the SD port in the destination switch. The FC
        tunnel must be first bound to an ST port in the source

        SPAN: Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) is a feature that
           enables user to analyze network traffic in a
           switched network using network analyzer attached
           to a switch port.

        RSPAN: Remote SPAN that enables monitoring of traffic
           from remote switches.

        FC tunnel: An FC tunnel is a logical data path
           between a source switch and destination switch.

        SPAN tunnel (ST) port: The ST port is used to forward
           traffic to FC tunnel.

        SPAN destination (SD) port: The SD port is used to 
           forward traffic to an Analyzer for monitoring

            above-listed shared resource objects for that 
            interface is set to its default value.

        When an interface is in the 'outOfService' state then:

          - the interface cannot be involved in a port swap

          - ifAdminStatus in IF-MIB cannot be changed to 'up'

          - other interface objects are not affected.

        Changing the value of this object on one interface to
        'outOfService' does not affect the functionality of any 
        other interface.

        When an attempt is made to change a particular interface's
